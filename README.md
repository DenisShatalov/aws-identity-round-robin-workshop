# aws-identity-round-robin-workshop
This workshop is composed of a series of rounds covering a range of identity and access management topics. These topics cover identity in general, not just the AWS IAM service. To that end you will find coverage for platform identity, application identity and infrastructure identity on AWS. Some of the services covered (this is not a complete list) include AWS IAM, AWS CloudTrail, Amazon CloudWatch Events, Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, Amazon Macie, Amazon Inspector and Amazon GuardDuty.
